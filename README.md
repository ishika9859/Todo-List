# Todo-List

A dynamic To-Do List web app built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript with Local Storage support to retain tasks even after page refresh.

## Overview

This project is an interactive and user-friendly To-Do List application that helps users manage their daily tasks efficiently. Unlike basic task apps, this version uses browser Local Storage to persist data, ensuring tasks remain saved even after refreshing or reopening the browser. The project focuses on strengthening core front-end concepts and real-world usability.

## Tools and Technologies

* HTML – Structure and layout
* CSS – Styling and responsive design
* JavaScript – Functionality and logic

## Methods

* DOM manipulation for dynamic task rendering
* Event listeners for adding and deleting tasks
* Local Storage integration using `setItem()` and `getItem()`
* JSON conversion for storing structured task data
* Real-time UI updates after user interaction

## Key Insights

* Understood the practical use of Local Storage in web apps
* Improved knowledge of DOM re-rendering after state updates
* Practiced handling browser-based data lifecycle
* Built a more real-world useful mini application  

## Output

The final output is a fully functional To-Do List application that includes:

* Add new tasks
* Delete tasks
* Real-time task display
* Persistent storage (tasks remain after refresh)
* Clean and minimal UI

## How to Run this project?

1. Download or clone the project files.
2. Keep HTML, CSS, and JS files in the same folder.
3. Open `index.html` in any web browser.
4. Start adding tasks — they will remain saved even after refresh.

## Results & Conclusion

The project successfully demonstrates how a simple web app can become significantly more practical by adding persistence using Local Storage. It highlights the power of core JavaScript in building real-life usable applications without relying on frameworks or backend technologies.

## Future Work

* Add task completion toggle (mark as done)
* Add edit/update task feature
* Implement due dates and reminders
* Convert into a full-stack version with database support
